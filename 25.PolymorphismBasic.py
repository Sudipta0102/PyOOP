# 1. Polymorphism means many forms.
# 2. One example of it would be len(). 
#   a. When it receives a string it prints length of the same.
#   b. and when it receives a list of String, It gives the length of List instead.
# so it adapts to the situation it's in.
# 3. So in a nutshell, when one single entity you can use for multiple objects in a way
# that's relevent to that particular object, that's basically polymorphism.
# 
# In this context, the apply_increment() method is accessible from from the parent class,
# or any child class to define their own increment rate. Here I can achieve polumorphism 
# that way.
